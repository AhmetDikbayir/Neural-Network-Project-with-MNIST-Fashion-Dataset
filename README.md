# Neural-Network-Project-with-MNIST-Fashion-Dataset
I used MNIST Fashion Dataset in this project. Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article imagesâ€”consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. 
Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes. 
Zalando intends Fashion-MNIST to serve as a direct drop-in replacement for the original MNIST dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms. 
It shares the same image size and structure of training and testing splits. 

I used Keras Sequential Model in this project. I used ReLU activation function, and 10 output layers. 
I tried my model with 10 iterations, so as a result of this iterations my model accuracy score was 0.91. 

After that I tried my model with 20 iterations and lastly my model accuracy score increased 0.93.
